# socket-introduction
Simple example of chat using socket server
# Requirement:
> python 3

# To test:
> Run python3 server.py - To start the local server
>> Open new terminal and Run python3 client.py and then type anything and you will find that same text on the terminal where you run the server. So this is how can we send the data to the server (Can create a cron for this to send the data to the server whenver new data is available) and on server side we can save it to the database.
